Oracle Java on Docker
=====
This repository contains sample Docker configurations to facilitate installation and environment setup for DevOps users. This project includes Dockerfiles based on Oracle Linux with JDK images of currently supported versions 11 and later and for Server JRE 8.

Oracle Java Server JRE provides the features from Oracle Java JDK commonly required for server-side applications (i.e. Running a Java EE application server). For more information about Server JRE, visit the [Understanding the Server JRE blog entry](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/understanding-the-server-jre) from the Java Product Management team.

## Building the Oracle Java base image
Download the linux x-64 compressed archive (tar.gz) [JDK or Server JRE] (https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) for the version you want to create an image of and place it in the same directory as the corresponding Dockerfile.

e.g. for JDK 14 download jdk-14[X]_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz into OracleJava/14, 
for ServerJRE 8 download server-jre-8uXXX-linux-x64.tar.gz into OracleJava/8

Navigate to the folder containing the download and run docker build. Tag it with the correct version number.

e.g. For JDK 14 run
```
$ cd ../OracleJava/14
$ docker build -t oracle/jdk:14 .
```

for Server JRE 8 run
```
$ cd ../OracleJava/8
$ docker build -t oracle/serverjre:8 .
```

The right command with the correct tag is already scripted in build.sh so you can alternatively run:
```
$ bash build.sh
```
